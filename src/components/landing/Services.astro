          I am what you call a gym bro. I try to lift consistently using the
          Push/Pull/Legs split. From the beginning of my journey to freshman
          year of college, I have lost 60 pounds. Ever since then, I have been
          tracking my diet and occasionally switching between the bulk and
          cutting stages. Currently weighing at 180lbs, and on a cut until I
          reach ~165lbs.

        <p class="mt-3 text-eagle">
          Even before my lifting journey, I have been immersed in multiple
          sports. In the past, I have played baseball, football, and basketball,
          but have only recently been playing basketball. I have also picked up
          golf recently, which I find very fun and will be investing more in the
          sport. My handicap is currently unknown, but hoping to figure it out
          soon!

          From a young age, I have been playing instruments, such as piano,
          drums, and guitar. Guitar is my most comfortable instrument as I find
          it to be the most relaxing and fun to practice. I have served as an
          acoustic and electric guitarist for church bands for about 5-6 years,
          but am now playing the instrument in my own time.

          Last, but not least, I am a big fan of coding. Some days, you will
          find me on Leetcode trying to solve the daily or medium problems, and
          other days, I am coding up or planning a personal project. I am
          currently learning more about AI/ML, while also putting in more
          practice in web development, which is a field I have the most passion
          in.
